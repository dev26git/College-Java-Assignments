# Assignment 10
WAP demonstrating Multithreading in Java.

The program creates 2 thread classes:
1. Factorial thread: Calculate the factorial of a given number.
2. NaturalNumberSum thread: Calculates the sum of all natural numbers up to a given number. This method does not use the formula but the brute force method.

The program uses multithreading to execute these two in parallel while giving a pause of 500 ms between each iteration.

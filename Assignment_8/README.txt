Part 1: Write a Java Program to find the factorial of ‘n’ integers (as command line arguments CLA). Write your own exception “MyExcep” to validate integer values to be in certain range.

Part 2:
Define an exception class called “NOMATCHEXCP” that is thrown when the string from keyboard is not equal to “India”. Write a Demo program using try-catch block that shows the use of this user-defined exception. class NOMATCHEXCP should have a parameterized constructor and the exception message generated should show the line number and the erroneous String that was inputted by the user.

Identify and create user-defined exceptions for your project.
